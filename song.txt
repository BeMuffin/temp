Trembling
Crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold dead eyes
Stealing the life of mine
I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't last long
In this world so wrong
Say goodbye
As we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Say goodbye
As we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on
Goodbye
